## Hello

I'm Felix Tellmann
I'm a freelancing web developer, writer and entrepreneur living in Cape Town. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide real value to its users.

My portfolio website - build with [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org) and deployed on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). Under the hood I'm using mdx with next-mdx-enhanced for local development, and next-mdx-remote for production. (There is a massive speed difference for both uses in their environments.).

The newsletter sign-up is integrated with [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) as a simple markdown newsletter provider.

## Setup

Feel free to clone the page for *learning purposes*.

```bash
$ git https://github.com/FelixTellmann/FelixTellmann.com.git
$ cd FelixTellmann.com
$ npm install (or run yarn install if you are using yarn)
$ npm run dev (yarn dev)
```

Signup with buttondown to generate an API key and setup `.env` file from the `.env.example` file. If you deploy the site to Vercel, ensure that you setup Environmental keys for production.
