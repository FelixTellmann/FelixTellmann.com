          I'm a freelancing web developer, writer and entrepreneur living in Cape Town. I enjoy creating things that live on the
          internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that
          provide real value to its users.

          My focus area for the past few years has been front-end development with{' '}
          <Link href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" title="React" />,{' '}
          <Link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" title="Typescript" /> and{' '}
          <Link href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank" title="Next.js" />
           to create beautiful user (and developer) experiences that bring delight. I'm also currently experimenting with
          Chrome Extensions & Next.js for some small side projects.

        <h2 className="h3">Passion for technology</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve spent most of my life deeply interested in technology & mind-buggling puzzles continuously building things with
          both. As a teenager, I was a classic computer nerd, spending most of my times messing with the computer, doing 1 of 4
          things: coding with software and programs and figuring things out. Tinkering with the hardware and building/ruining
          computers by experimenting too much. Building websites with FrontPage 98 and Flash. And of course, playing games.
        </p>
        <p>Most of that is still true today.</p>
        <p>
          I love building things, challenging ideas, seeking knowledge and creating opportunities. I enjoy finding patterns in
          things, constructing models for how the world works, and then discussing, sharing, and using that information to improve
          the world in some way.
