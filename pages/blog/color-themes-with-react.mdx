Over the last few weeks i've been upgrading my website with a complete
 redesign, including dark-mode functionality. I've found a some good resources to add a dark-mode / light
 -mode switcher, but very little info to do proper theming with more than
  just two themes.

My answer: [use-color-theme](https://github.com/FelixTellmann/use-color-theme).
A simple react hook that toggles `light-theme`, `dark-theme` and any other
 class on the `body` tag. The hook is works with CSS [custom
  properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) and uses
   `prefers-color-scheme` and localStorage under the hood to match users
    perferences and eliminate the *flash* problem thats often associated with
     color theming.
