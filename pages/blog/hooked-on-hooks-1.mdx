React Hooks have been around for a while now, yet they are still as awesome
as on day one. With the amount of custom hooks developed by the community they are like a superpower for any developer.
Pretty awesome, right?

## Whats it all about?

The change to React Hooks, which came out in [version 16.8](https://reactjs
.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), has had some massive impact on choosing a
 programming paradigm. Whats to choose from? _Object-Oriented Programming_
  (OOP) and _Functional Programming_.

<blockquote>
  The idea behind Object oriented programming is that you create a blueprint for what your ‘object’ looks like and call that over
  and over again to do whatever you want with it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Functional programming is a programming paradigm that works under idea and assumption that what you put into the function is not
  expected to change. It stems from the mathematical idea where an equation returns an expected and only that value equivalent of
  y when x is plugged in.
