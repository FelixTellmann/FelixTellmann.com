One key feature of Hooks is allowing functional components to have access to the react lifecycle.
In the class-based way of creating `stateful` components, you have access to the `componentDidMount`,
`componentWillMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount ` events. The events are super useful to add
things like eventListeners to the DOM, make API calls, and to fine-tune performance to ensure
that only components that need to render, actually render.


import { IframeExample, InfoBlock, Link } from 'components';

With Hooks, we get the **`useEffect()`** API which allows you access to the React Lifecycle.

The `useEffect` function is triggered when the component is first rendered, and after that on
every re-render or update to props & state. You can also set (and should set) the useEffect
hook to only run conditionally, based on specific changes to improve performance and avoid
memory leaks and unnecessary render calls. In terms of the React Lifecycle, the `useEffect`
hook runs after the DOM is loaded, which is great in comparison to accessing the lifecycle
in class components, which can block the UI from being rendered.

Additionally, there are also the `useMutationEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks which give
us even more precise access into the React lifecycle and I will get more into detail in another post.

## How to: useEffect()

Let's have a look at the example in plain javascript below

```tsx{6-15}
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const MousePosition = () => {
  const [{x, y}, setCoordinates] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const onMouseMove = (e) => {
      setCoordinates({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    };

    if (window) {
      document.addEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    }
    return () => { document.removeEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove) }
  }, []);

  return <>
    <div>
      Your cursor coordinates are X: {x}, and Y: {y}
    </div>
  </>;
};
```

First, we load the `useEffect` hook from `react`, and then we initiate it in the component.
The hook requires a callback function and an optional array which include the dependencies.
The **callback function** is run after the UI is rendered and the DOM is loaded. Depending on
your environment and if you use Server Side Rendering, it is still a good idea to check if
the `window` object has been instantiated to avoid errors during build time.

In the above example we use the `useEffect` hook to create an eventListener for `mousemove`
to track a global event.

```tsx
return () => { document.removeEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove) }
```
Lastly, the return part runs on `componentWillUnmount` and allows you to clean up the eventListener once it is
not needed anymore.

You can see that the hook also has an empty `array` as a second argument. The array contains
any conditional dependencies that should trigger the effect to run again. An empty array
means the effect only runs once after the first render and never again until dismounted.

Here is the code in action, just move your cursor over the box:

## Typescript needed?

The beauty about using typescript in your dev environment comes once again through type inference
and types provided by `@types/react` which gives you some amazing hints, right as you need them.
