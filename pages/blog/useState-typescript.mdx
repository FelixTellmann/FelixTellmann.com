## Introdocution

React Hooks have been around for a while now, yet they are still as awesome
as on day one. With the number of custom hooks developed by the community, they are like a
superpower for any developer. Pretty awesome, right?

The change to React Hooks, which came out in
[version 16.8](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), has had some massive impact on
choosing a programming paradigm, giving _Functional Programming_ a new edge.

Let's find out how we can use the useState hook and how it works with Typescript.

import { InfoBlock, Link, IframeExample } from 'components';

## Anatomy of the useState hook

The `useState` hook is by far the react hook I use the most often. Using the hook allows
us to build entire apps only using Functional Components and without any supersized
`class` based components that hold the state of the entire application.

Here's how the `useState()` API works: we load the `useState` function from `react` and
initiate it within a _Functional Component_ `const [number, setNumber] = useState(0)`
the function takes in one argument as the _intial state_ and returns an array with two items:
the variable containing the state and a function to set the state.

Here is a plain javascript example:

```jsx:example.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Your number is {number}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number + 1)}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number - 1)}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Try it out:

You can add as many useState() calls as you want. The main limitation is that the calls
have to be made within the top level of the Functional Component. It is not possible to call
react hooks conditionally or in a nested block.

## Adding Typescript

Adding types to components is a great way to handle increased complexity as a developer.
It's like telling your future self what needs to be done where and when. In the above example,
we wouldn't need to add a single type annotation as all the necessary types are _inferred_.

<InfoBlock type="quote">
  Type inference is the ability to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time. The compiler is often
  able to infer the type of a variable or the type signature of a function, without explicit type annotations having been given.
</InfoBlock>

The most practical type we could add is the initial state. This is especially useful if there
isn't any initial value. Here is a quick example:

```tsx:example.tsx
import { ChangeEvent, FC, useState } from "react";

const Welcome: FC = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState<string>()

  return (
      <div>
        <p>Please type in your name:</p>
        <input type="text" onChange={(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setName(e.currentTarget.value)}/>
        <h2>{name ? `Welcome ${name}.` : null}</h2>
      </div>
  )
}
```
