## Introdocution

React Hooks have been around for a while now, yet they are still as awesome
as on day one. With the amount of custom hooks developed by the community they are like a
superpower for any developer. Pretty awesome, right?

The change to React Hooks, which came out in
[version 16.8](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), has had some massive impact on
choosing a programming paradigm, giving _Functional Programming_ a new edge.

Let's find out how we can use the useState hook and how it works with Typescript.

import { InfoBlock, Link, IframeExample } from 'components';

## Anatomy of the useState hook

The `useState` hook is by far the react hook I use the most often. Using the hook allows
us to build entire apps only using Functional Components and without any supersized
`class` based components that hold the state of the entire application.


Here's how the `useState()` API works.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
```

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

const Counter = () => {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Your number is {number}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number + 1)}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number - 1)}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
